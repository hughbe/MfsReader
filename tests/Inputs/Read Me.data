This Read Me document provides:• important information about Macintosh system software version 6.0.8• additional information about several models of Macintosh computersSome of this information is not in the documentation that came with your computer. You may wish to print this Read Me document and keep it for future reference.------------------------------------------------------------------------------- INFORMATION ABOUT SYSTEM SOFTWARE VERSION 6.0.8-------------------------------------------------------------------------------BEFORE YOU INSTALL VERSION 6.0.8Before using the Installer program, be sure to remove any virus detection or security programs from your System Folder. After you have installed version 6.0.8, you can reinstall these programs. IF YOU SHARE A LASERWRITER PRINTER ON A NETWORKIf you upgrade to version 6.0.8 and you are on a network of shared LaserWriter printers, all other users on your network should upgrade to version 6.0.8 or System 7, or install at least the new printing software (using the Customize option in the Installer program). If someone prints on a network with a version of printing software earlier than 6.0.8, the printer must stop and "initialize" for that earlier version each time it's used. This slows down the printing process for everyone.Also, note that when you have the Chooser program open, your computer’s performance will be slower. When you’re not using the Chooser, close it.IF YOU ARE USING A PERSONAL LASERWRITER SC OR LASERWRITER IISC:The Personal LaserWriter SC printing software replaces the earlier LaserWriter IISC software. If you upgrade your system software to version 6.0.8, the LaserWriter IISC software will be replaced automatically by the Personal LaserWriter SC version. The new software works with BOTH the Personal LaserWriter SC and the LaserWriter IISC, and works exactly the same way as the earlier software. IF YOU USE ETHERTALK If you are using an Apple EtherTalk card in the Macintosh IIci or the Macintosh IIfx, be sure to use the Apple Network Products Installer disk to install or reinstall the EtherTalk software. You’ll find instructions for using this Installer in the Network Products Installer booklet included with your computer. IF YOU ARE USING A/UXBefore you upgrade your A/UX computer to system software version 6.0.8, you should be familiar with A/UX, know how to log in to the root account, and know how to use the CommandShell. If you need more information on these A/UX procedures, see Chapters 1, 2, and 5 of “A/UX Essentials.”To upgrade an A/UX system to version 6.0.8, first use the Installer program to install version 6.0.8 on your MacPartition hard disk. Instructions are in the reference material that came with your Macintosh. Next, follow these steps to update your A/UX System Folder(s): 1. Start up A/UX and log in to the root account. 2. Open the hard disk icon labeled “/.” 3. Insert either the 6.0.8 Printing Tools disk or the 6.0.8 System Additions disk in the floppy drive. The floppy disk icon appears on the desktop.4. Open the floppy disk icon.5. Select these files (if you use the System Additions disk, these files are in the Printing Tools folder):LaserWriterLaserWriter PrepPrintMonitor6. Drag the selected files to the folder labeled “tmp” on the “/” hard disk.7. Open a CommandShell by selecting CommandShell from the Apple menu. The “#” prompt appears.8. 	Enter these commands to copy the printer files to your A/UX system:cd /tmpcp "Laser Prep" PrintMonitor /mac/lib/SystemFiles/sharedcp LaserWriter /mac/lib/SystemFiles/private9.  Enter this command to update the global system folder on your computer:cp LaserWriter /mac/sys/"System Folder"10. Repeat step 9 for each personal System Folder on your computer, replacing /mac/sys/"System Folder" with the name of the personal System Folder to be updated.11. Log out. At this point you have finished upgrading your A/UX system to version 6.0.8. The next time you log in, use the Chooser to select printers. Select a printer for each account that has an updated personal System Folder.------------------------------------------------------------------------------ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT SEVERAL MACINTOSH MODELS------------------------------------------------------------------------------IF YOU HAVE A MACINTOSH IIsi OR MACINTOSH LCThe Macintosh IIsi and the Macintosh LC do not have a floating point unit (a coprocessor that improves performance during intensive mathematical calculations). Some application programs require a floating point unit.  If you try to use one of these programs with a Macintosh IIsi or a Macintosh LC, you may see the message "Coprocessor not installed," or the message "The application has unexpectedly quit." You can add a floating point unit to the Macintosh IIsi by installing a NuBus adapter card or an 030 Direct Slot Adapter Card.  The Macintosh LC cannot be upgraded to include a floating point unit. IF YOU HAVE A MACINTOSH PLUS OR A MACINTOSH SEWhen printing shadow, outline, or boldface text in large point sizes on the LaserWriter IISC, the ImageWriter LQ, or the AppleFax Modem, some characters may not print.  The problem varies depending upon the application program, font, font style, and font size you use. You can avoid this problem by using plain text.
